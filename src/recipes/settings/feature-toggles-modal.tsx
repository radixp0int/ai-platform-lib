/**
 * The demo's feature-toggle shell — and nothing but a shell.
 *
 * Everything inside it comes from `components/settings`, driven by the
 * catalogue in demoFeatures.ts. That split is the point: the dialog, its
 * anchoring, the title and the reset footer are this app's opinions, while the
 * switch list is the library's. The two appearance pickers are the library's
 * too, but they are a viewer preference rather than presenter chrome, so they
 * sit in UserSettingsModal — which is exactly the regrouping a product does
 * when it drops these components into its own account settings.
 *
 * Anchored right rather than centred, with a light unblurred scrim: a centred
 * dialog would hide the very conversation these switches change. It is still a
 * true modal — a native <dialog> in the top layer, so focus trapping, Esc, and
 * inertness of the page behind it come from the platform.
